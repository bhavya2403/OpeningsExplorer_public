I've set the project such that you can easily open the website on local server and start working on it just by cloning the project and installing requirements.txt. There is only one change in this code vs the code running on Azure is the database connection which in this case it's
CSV file of 5000 games vs 1M games on the original website.

Website is hosted on: https://openingexplorer.azurewebsites.net/
